“Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, today is a gift of God, which is why we call it the present.” 
“Listen to the mustn'ts, child. Listen to the don'ts. Listen to the shouldn'ts, the impossibles, the won'ts. Listen to the never haves, then listen close to me... Anything can happen, child. Anything can be.”
“Hold fast to dreams, For if dreams die Life is a broken-winged bird, That cannot fly.” 
“Maybe everyone can live beyond what they're capable of.”
